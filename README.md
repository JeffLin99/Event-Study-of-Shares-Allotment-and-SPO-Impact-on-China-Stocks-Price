# Event-Study-of-Shares-Allotment-and-SPO-Impact-on-China-Stocks-Price
This project focuses on examining the impact of two events, shares allotment and Secondary Public Offering (SPO), on stock prices. The expected outcomes encompass analyzing two effects of shares allotment - price decrease due to ex-rights and price change from information conveyed by allotment. Additionally, the project aims to understand the effects of SPO on stock price volatility based on fund allocation and investor sentiment influenced by the SPO volume.
